# Introduction for the Hemnet team

Hello hello Hemnet team ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

So. It was a big pleasure for me to work on this assignment.
I would like to say I had a lot of fun, particularly modeling the domain layer üòá

## About the existing tests

I did change the implementation of the tests but not the logic it wants to assert.
So all the IT descriptions are there as they were before.
I also kept the original implementation commented out.
But I had to adapt the calls to work with the new implementation of the assignment.

- **PASS** src/application-layer/services/tests/price.spec.ts
- PriceService
- ‚úÖ Returns the pricing history for the provided year and package (62 ms)
- ‚úÖ Supports filtering on municipality (23 ms)

- **PASS** src/application-layer/services/tests/package.spec.ts
- PackageService
- ‚úÖ Updates the current price of the provided package (35 ms)
- ‚úÖ Stores the old price of the provided package in its price history (16 ms)
- ‚úÖ Supports adding a price for a specific municipality (16 ms)

# Concepts I did use in this assignment

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

I did all the domain modelling of this assignment, using domain-driven design.

I'm really happy with the final result,
(there are always improvements to be done. But it is already really good).

It was super helpful because I started by reading the description of the assignment and sketching the entities and value-objects
to see how they connect to each other.
I ended up with different possibilities that I discarded in preference to the current one.

But I remember for example I started with Package being the aggregate, but then some cross dependencies were happening, as the package knowing about its price but price also knowing about the package.

At the beginning as well, price was a value-object but then I started to challenge it and try different approaches to check how the implementation of the services would look like then (if it was getting way too complex then I was looking back).

I also remember at first I did just a Package entity with a type (Basic, Plus, Premium), but I was not happy with this because these packages are the first thing discussed in the assignment so I want to make them more visible in the domain layer. I was also in doubt whether they should be a value-object or an entity.

Anyway üòÉ.
Modelling domains is a thing that I really love üòç.
I did not have much time to do it here as I would in real life.
But I did my best and am happy with the result üòá

## Clean Architecture

I did a folder restructure to follow the simple clean-architecture in the picture.
Normally I would not suffix the layers with the word "layer". But I did for quick review understanding üòÉ

### Layers

- presentation layer
- application layer
- domain layer
- infrastructure layer

With this layering the goal was to keep everything related to the Express framework in the **presentation layer**.
Even though I did not have the time to work in this layer as well üò¨
Every request and response communication concern between server and client will be taken care of in this layer.

So all the use case logic handling will be at **application layer**.
This layer works as an orchestrator between the other layers here.
It is aware of the domain layer (more internal layer)
But it is not aware of the infrastructure layer and presentation layer (more external layer).

The **domain layer** is the heart of the application.
There all the core business logic of the application sits.
This layer does not know about other layers.
It is totally agnostic to frameworks, databases, etc

Then to finish we have the **infrastructure layer**
This layer is responsible for persistence of data.
Would be responsible as well to connect with external APIs (if it was the case)
And every other necessity of "infrastructure" needed

### Dependency Inversion

One particularity I bring from clean architecture as well is the inversion of the dependencies.
What does that mean?
If you go to domain services or application services, you will see the constructors of it always depend on interfaces instead of real implementations.
It creates a decoupling...

So my constructors ask for ports (interfaces), and the outer layers pick the adapters (actual implementations).
The win is simple: I can swap SQLite for something else, or plug in test doubles, without touching the domain or application logic.
It also keeps the domain pure (no ORM types sneaking in), and all the wiring would live at the edges (controllers).
In short: fewer surprises, easier testing, and freedom to change infra later without a big refactor.

## SOLID

Let me exemplify how I used SOLID principles in the domain and application layers üòå:

- **Single Responsibility (S):** Domain entities/value-objects encapsulate their own rules and state transitions (e.g., `municipality.entity.ts` only manages municipality invariants and updates; value objects like `value-cents.value-object.ts` validate and compare monetary amounts). Application/domain services orchestrate use cases without leaking infra (`price.domain-service.ts`, `package.domain-service.ts`).

- **Open/Closed (O):** domain depends on repository interfaces (`domain-layer/repositories/*.ts`), allowing new persistence implementations under `infrastructure-layer/**/repositories` without changing domain code. Package variants are modeled via separate classes (`Basic/Plus/Premium`), so adding a new variant extends behavior with minimal impact.

- **Liskov Substitution (L):** `BasicPackage`, `PlusPackage`, and `PremiumPackage` extend `AbstractPackage` and can be used wherever an `AbstractPackage` is expected (e.g., `Price.package: AbstractPackage`, repository returns `AbstractPackage`).

- **Interface Segregation (I):** small, focused interfaces (`IPriceRepository`, `IPackageRepository`, `IMunicipalityRepository`) expose only the methods each service needs, avoiding fat interfaces.

- **Dependency Inversion (D):** services depend on abstractions, not concretions (e.g., `PriceDomainService` constructor takes `IPriceRepository`, `IPackageRepository`, `IMunicipalityRepository`), while concrete implementations live in infrastructure (`infrastructure-layer/db-sqlite-sequelize/repositories`).

# Final considerations

Thanks again to the Hemnet team for the opportunity of playing with this test assignment.
I would love to discuss in a follow-up all the aspects of my implementation of it.
Looking forward to talking to you again.
See ya
