The application layer should have the mappers needed to recognize what comes from presentation layer and what goes to there

Example
	- fromEntityToResponseDto

Remember the application layer knows about the domain layer, but do not know about the presentation layer and infrastructure layer.
So the way of recognizing what is comming and going to the presentation layer is between these mappers.
The infrastructure layer implements the repository interfaces of the domain layer
